# BranchingPatterns_multistrain

*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* exhibits swarming behavior when cultivated on semi-solid surfaces. This [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01627-8) developed a model to simulate the swarming pattern formation in a co-culture consisting of three different PA14 strains: wildtype, hyperswarmer, and cheater. Each strain was characterized by distinct **growth rate, autonomous motility, and cooperative motility** combinations. This code extends the original model to accommodate multiple species, allowing each to be uniquely defined based on their specific traits across these three parameters.
