# Modeling Swarming Colony Patterns in Co-cultures of Multiple Bacterial Strains

In this [Nature Microbiology paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01627-8), a mathematical model has been developped to simulate the swarming colonies formed by up to three Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 strains, including the wildtype, hyperswarmer, and cheater. Each strain in this model was characterized by a unique combination of traits, including growth rate, autonomous motility, and cooperative motility.

Building on this foundation, the model has been extended to accommodate multiple species, each defined by its own unique trait combination. This extension allows for the modeling of complex microbial spatial communities composed of multiple strains.
